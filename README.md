Please DM `HugTed#6175` on discord for statistics functions and historical tracking. Due to data collection and storage concerns, tracking functions requiring data storage will require initial setup sequence.

## What's New!
### Profile Customization
Verified players can tip other verified players with the `~tip @user` command. These tips can be used to customize one's personal profile page. Including profile page color, profile avatar, custom badges, and more.

### MoE Tracking
Guilds can opt-in to MoE tracking which lets them use a request system to track member requests for MoE's and log the time when they where given out. This log is then viewable as a historical record.
