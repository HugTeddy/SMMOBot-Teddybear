## About
Discord bot designed for guilds and event owners to track/manage SimpleMMO activity of members. This includes guild leaderboards, historical activity tracking, activity graphing, and much more.

Please contact me on Discord: `HugTed#7154` for help!

## Invite
[Invite Link](https://gluebear.xyz/invite)

Please DM `HugTed#7154` on discord for statistics functions and historical tracking. Due to data collection and storage concerns, tracking functions requiring data storage will require initial setup sequence.

## What's New!
### Cosmetic Quizzes
Verifier players can take short multiple choice quizzes to access various cosmetics and other customization options. Check out `~dc` to get stared.

### Profile Customization
Verified players can tip other verified players with the `~tip @user` command. These tips can be used to customize one's personal profile page. Including profile page color, profile avatar, custom badges, and more.

### MoE Tracking
Guilds can opt-in to MoE tracking which lets them use a request system to track member requests for MoE's and log the time when they where given out. This log is then viewable as a historical record.
